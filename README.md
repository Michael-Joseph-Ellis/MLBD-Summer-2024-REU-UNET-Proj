# MLBD-Summer-2024-REU-UNET-Project

## Description
This repository contains my implementation of a UNet architecture for image segmentation, developed during the Summer 2024 Machine Learning and Big Data (MLBD) Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU). The project focuses on segmenting various types of off-road terrain in images, to then be implemented in AI powered cars for traversability, utilizing deep learning techniques to improve accuracy and performance.

## Features
- Implementation of the UNet model using PyTorch for image segmentation.
- Custom dataset loader for handling image and mask data.
- Training and testing scripts included with detailed performance metrics such as mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).
- Confusion matrix generation for model evaluation.
- Performance benchmarks including inference speed and memory usage.

## Technologies
- Python
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- PIL
- tqdm
- scikit-learn
